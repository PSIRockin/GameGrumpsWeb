# GameGrumpsWeb

This is a project with two other members I met in ASC as a little side project. We had to copy a website, but we were sad to find that there was no official Game Grumps website with general info about the team. So, with our small about of website-making skills, we made a small website that uses some Wikipedia info as filler (somewhat), and a general about welcome page. Happy viewing!
